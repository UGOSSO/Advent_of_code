This repository is a try to gather all my solution for advent of code problem. 

The algorithms are sorted by year and day, in each file you will see a part I one and a part II if there is not such part the function work for both part. 

For now, all solution are coded in python, I will try later to enhance the programming languages with C or C++ for exemple.

To use the solution copy the input from the advent of code site and paste them in the data.txt file
