This repository is a try to gather all my solution for advent of code problem. 

The algorithms are sorted by year and day, in each file you will see a part I one and a part II if there is not such part the function work for both part. 
I know that some of the algorithms are not optimal fell free to open an issue to explain to me how to upgrade them because I'm just a beginner and I'm willing to be better. 

For now, all solution are coded in python, I will try later to expand the number of languages with C, C++ or Java for example.

If you have any question on the working of an algorithm create an issue or send me a message by mail or on twitter. 

Hope you will enjoy this little contribution.
